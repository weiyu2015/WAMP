# WAMP

A database course project

MySql + PHP + HTML


This project is a web based music social network application which uses a database system to 
manage all application data. In the second part of this project, we modified the database backend 
for the system and designed a good-looking and smooth frontend webpage for the website. 
 
In our design, we want to contribute a platform for music fans to share their interest and exchange 
their collections. Fans will be the users, a user have to sign up to have a unique username on the 
website, then user can create profile and add or change personal information. A user can also post 
content, including picture, text or video to the website. User can also comment events or friendsâ€™ 
contents. 
 
MUSIC HUB is a kind of social network we can make friends and share our music but more than 
that we could consider it as a platform where we can post our own artworks and we can sell or buy 
some interested music products. Thus, there are two essential elements in our scenario in our 
choice, social and trade. We think they are the directions of the social networks development. And 
we also can make events or join events. And if users have interests in some events they can get 
together to have a great time, which is from online to offline, from virtual to reality. These are the 
basic functions of our application.
